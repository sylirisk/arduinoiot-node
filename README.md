# ArduinoIoT-Node
NodeJS scripts to access ArduinoIoT API

## The aim
The aim is to be able to create dynamic webpages, which can access the properties of Arduino IoT Cloud 'Things'.

## Status
Currently this only reads and outputs to console the value of the first property of an arduino cloud 'thing'. Stay tuned for more.
